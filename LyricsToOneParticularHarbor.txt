SONG
[v1]
  D                      C
I know I don't get there often enough
        D              C
But God knows I surely try
       D             C
It's a magic kind of medicine
        G      F         D
That no doctor could prescribe
G   F   D
 
          D                    C
I used to rule my world from a cell phone
 D               C
Ships out on the sea
         D         
But now times are rough
                   C
And I got too much stuff
         G        F        D
Can't explain the likes of me

[ch]
                 G    A7        D
But there's this one particular harbor
   G       A7     D
So far but yet so near
        G       A7           D    Bm
Where I see the days as they fade away
    G     A7    D
And finally disappear

[br]
                           A7
But now I think about the good times
                     D
Down in the Caribbean sunshine
                          A7
In my younger days I was so bad
                       D   G  D
Laughin' about all the fun we had
                          A7
I've seen enough to feel the world spin
                                 D
Mixin' different oceans, meeting cousins
                               A7
Listen to the drummers and the night sounds
                               D     G   D
Listen to the singers make the world go 'round

[in]
A           D
Ia ora te natura         (Ya Ra, Te naturah)
        A          D
E mea arofa teie ao nei  (mea-roha teh a nay)
A           D
Ia ora te natura        *Nature lives*
       A           D
E mea arofa teie ao nei *Have pity on the Earth*

[v2]
D                C
Lakes below the mountain
D             C
Flow into the sea
     D               C
Like oils applied to canvas
     G     F          D
They permeate through me

[ch2]
                 G    A7        D
And there's that one particular harbor
 G        A7       D
Sheltered from the wind    
           G       A7          D          Bm
Where the children play on the shore each day
    G       A7    D
And all are safe within
          G     A7       D
Most mysterious calling harbor
    G     A7      D
So far but yet so near
       G      A7          D           Bm
I can see the day when my hair's full gray
      G     A7    D
And I finally disappear

[dox]
A                D
*call and response*
       A                 D
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
       A                 D
Praise God all creatures here below
       G             D
Praise God above all heavenly hosts
       A                G   A  D      A D
Praise Father, Son, and Ho--ly Ghost
